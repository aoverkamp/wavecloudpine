  <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>hether it’s day or night, the resort town of Sliema thrums with activity. Historic cathedrals, watchtowers, and forts spatter the area, while along the waterfront locals shop, dine, bar hop, or stroll along the promenade for views of the shimmering Mediterranean.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Sliema is a stylish seaside town on a peninsula on Malta’s northeastern coastline. Visit this area to enjoy its elegant waterfront, rocky beaches, nightlife and superb retail experiences. The scene of a violent battle during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, Sliema then developed as a humble fishing village. The town rose to prominence in the 19th century, when British colonists shaped the architectural landscape and it became a summer retreat of affluent Maltese.</p>

  <h2>Valletta, APRIL 2025</h2>

<div class="block">
  <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>he smallest capital in the European Union, Valletta was established in the 1500s by the Knights of St. John, a Roman Catholic order who sought refuge in Malta during the Crusades. Named after Grand Master La Valette, it was to become Europe’s first planned city. It is flanked by two natural harbors, Marsamxett and Grand Harbour.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Thanks to its high concentration of historic monuments, Valletta was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. It has also been designated a European Capital of Culture for 2018. You might hear locals calling Valletta il-Belt ("The City") in their native Maltese language.</p>

  <h2>Mdina, APRIL 2025</h2>
</div>

<section>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="first-character atw">G</span>raceful Mdina, the stately town known as the Silent City, holds court from the southwest corner of the captivating island of Malta. The commanding medieval Old City perches on its rocky promontory, its fortified bastions looming above the azure waters of the Mediterranean. This enchanting Maltese city offers a warren of narrow streets, populated by churches, palaces and gracious houses, punctuated by large squares and delightfully free of cars in its UNESCO-designated ancient quarters.
  </p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Malta is a decidedly coastal nation. From the splendor of Valletta to the beautiful Blue Grotto, Malta’s beautiful coastline is the main draw for foreign visitors. I had to admit that it did feel wrong to travel inland. However, almost every travel guide mentions that if you pick one place to visit inland, it would be Mdina. Being in the center of the island, Mdina is easily accessible from just about everywhere by public transportation. Mdina was the capital of medieval Malta and the center of the island’s religious life. For some, the city’s real claim of fame is its status as the filming location of the popular HBO series Game of Thrones (GOH). Famously, Mdina stood in as King's Landing, the capital of the fictional Seven Kingdoms. Of course, Mdina never capitalizes on its GOH connection as much as Dubrovnik, but I would argue it is just as atmospheric and photogenic. </p>
