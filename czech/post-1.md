Tokyo is a rush of pure adrenaline with its futuristic skyscrapers, unrivaled food scene, and wild nightlife. The city is famously cutting-edge, yet its ancient Buddhist temples, vintage teahouses, and peaceful gardens offer a serene escape—and a reminder of its past. Spend the morning in Asakusa, Tokyo’s historical neighborhood, to see the Sensoji temple, then take a stroll along the Sumida River (in the spring, the cherry blossoms are in full force). Or, make your way to Tsukiji Outer Market for a sushi breakfast—the narrow corridors are packed with tons of spots to choose from (most close around noon so get there early). Turn up the volume and get a taste for cosplay culture in Harajuku, or hit Akihabara for video games and anime. In the evening, take a detour down a yokocho—a little side street alleyway—to find laid-back izakayas and chill bars.

Tokyo is located on Tokyo Bay in the Kanto region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. The closest airport airports are Haneda officially known as Tokyo International Airport, and Narita Airport, Japan's largest international airport. Tokyo is known for its fashion and shopping, from the trendy shopping districts of Harajuku and Shibuya, to the luxury flagships of Ginza.
