  <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>here’s something extra-special about Prague that sets it apart from the other big cities of Europe. Whether it’s the Gothic cathedrals and Baroque palaces, or the more than 200 gardens scattered across the city, Prague offers a true escape from the modern world. For architecture and history buffs, there’s really nowhere better to be. From the heart of Old Town Square to Prague Castle up on the hill, you could spend your days wandering up and down the river, marveling at the city. It’s also one of the classical music capitals of the world—be sure to catch a show at the Art Nouveau Municipal House (an architectural marvel, too). Don’t leave without throwing back a pint or two—travelers say Prague has some of the best beer in Europe.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Prague was once a hidden gem, overshadowed by its flashier neighbors to the west. But the city couldn't keep its marvels a secret for too long – now, it's a haven for travelers seeking awe-inspiring experiences at affordable prices. Even today, top attractions – including the famous Charles Bridge and the historic Prague Castle – offer free admission and many hotels offer rooms at a fraction of the cost of other European cities. But this bargain-hunting legacy has a ticking clock on it, so if you're hoping to find a fire-sale price, now's the time to do so.</p>

  <h2>Dresden, OCTOBER 2019</h2>

  <p><span class="first-character atw">O</span>n the banks of the lovely Elbe River, the German city of Dresden is lush and green, filled with forests and gardens and parks. The city is rich with cultural and artistic history; the great operatic composer Wilhelm Wagner debuted a number of works here in the 1800s and, today, an independent light opera company keeps the classical art form modern and fresh. Culture vultures will love the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister and Grünes Gewölbe museums, and architecture buffs will salivate over the mélange of styles reflected in the cityscape.
  </p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">It goes without saying, you can't visit Dresden without seeing these distinguished cultural monuments. That's why the Frauenkirche, the Zwinger and the Semper Opera House also belong to the first day of your city tour. The good news is that these impressive landmarks are close to each other in the Old Town area.</p>
