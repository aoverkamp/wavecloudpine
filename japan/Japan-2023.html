      <p><span class="first-character sc">O</span>ur two and a half week trip through Japan was a whirlwind, taking us from the lively streets of Tokyo to the peaceful temples of Kyoto, all filled with amazing sights and cultural gems—not to mention a lot of gashapon! We started in Tokyo, checking out historical spots like Nihonbashi, soaking in the spiritual vibe at Sensō-ji, and enjoying the buzz over in Odaiba. Then, we moved on to Kamakura, where the ancient temples entranced us, and we got lucky and had stunning views of Mt. Fuji from Hakone. Kyoto was next, with its classic charm. We also strolled through the beautiful bamboo forests in Arashiyama, stood in awe of Himeji Castle, dove into Osaka’s crazy street food scene, and soaked up the rich art and history in Kanazawa. This adventure really captured the spirit of Japan, and we were racking up over 30,000 steps a day while at it.</p>

        <h2>TOKYO, OCTOBER 2023</h2>

      <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>okyo is a rush of pure adrenaline with its futuristic skyscrapers, unrivaled food scene, and wild nightlife. The city is famously cutting-edge, yet its ancient Buddhist temples, vintage teahouses, and peaceful gardens offer a serene escape—and a reminder of its past. Spend the morning in Asakusa, Tokyo’s historical neighborhood, to see the Sensoji temple, then take a stroll along the Sumida River (in the spring, the cherry blossoms are in full force). Or, make your way to Tsukiji Outer Market for a sushi breakfast—the narrow corridors are packed with tons of spots to choose from (most close around noon so get there early). Turn up the volume and get a taste for cosplay culture in Harajuku, or hit Akihabara for video games and anime. In the evening, take a detour down a yokocho—a little side street alleyway—to find laid-back izakayas and chill bars. </p>

      <p class="margin-top-10">Tokyo is located on Tokyo Bay in the Kanto region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. The closest airport airports are Haneda officially known as Tokyo International Airport, and Narita Airport, Japan's largest international airport. Tokyo is known for its fashion and shopping, from the trendy shopping districts of Harajuku and Shibuya, to the luxury flagships of Ginza.</p>

      <h2>KYOTO, OCTOBER 2023</h2>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character ny">K</span>yoto, Japan’s capital for over 1,000 years, offers a rare link between modern life in a city and its very ancient past. Here, Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, Zen rock gardens, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites are at every turn. Visit the 7th-century Shimogamo Shrine with its stunning arcade of orange gates, the elegant Kinkakuji Temple with a gold-leaf exterior perfectly reflected in a placid lake, and Kiyomizu-dera Temple with a hillside location that makes for spectacular city views. Still the center of traditional Japanese culture, Kyoto is the place to experience a tea ceremony, savor multi-course Kaiseki haute cuisine, and catch sight of a geisha as you stroll through Gion at dusk. </p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">To enjoy the charms that Kyoto has to offer, it's recommended to make use of less busy times to visit shrines – early in the morning, or late at night when they're lit up, for example. Additionally, you can divide Kyoto into a number of areas, complete with their own unique beauty and charm. In central Kyoto , there are a number of historic buildings and unforgettable pristine old townscapes for travelers to visit. </p>

      <h2>OSAKA, OCTOBER 2023</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character atw">O</span>saka is only a short shinkansen ride from Tokyo, but has a very different personality to Japan's capital city. Hop off the bullet train into an area of exciting nightlife, delicious food and straight-talking, friendly locals. Along with plenty of shopping and modern attractions, Osaka also has a historical side, the highlight of which is Osaka Castle. The castle is a great place to discover more about Japanese history and to wander the beautiful grounds, especially during cherry blossom season in April when the sakura blooms and the weather is often at its best. </p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">Called “the nation’s kitchen,” Osaka delivers a standout dining scene. Feast on street food and work your way through the city’s many “Bib Gourmand” restaurants—a Michelin award for spots that serve exceptional food at reasonable prices. Use food crawls to fuel your explorations. Go shopping in Minami, check out nightlife in the neon-lit extravaganza of Dotombori, join the theme park fun at Universal Studios Japan, then take a breather at Osaka Castle, with its peaceful gardens and exceptional city views. Osaka is also an ideal home base for exploring the Kansai region—Kyoto's World Heritage Sites and Nara's temples are about an hour by train.</p>
