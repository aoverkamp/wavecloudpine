    <p><span class="first-character sc">S</span>pent a few wild, unforgettable days exploring Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park; waking up to misty mornings and buffalo just outside the lodge, catching glimpses of elk, coyotes, and even a bear along the way. Hiked around steaming geysers, colorful springs, and alpine lakes with rain jackets on standby and cameras always ready. We looped trails at Jenny Lake, wandered the terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs, and chased views at Schwabacher Landing and Oxbow Bend. Every turn seemed to offer something new from a lone bison blocking our dinner path to rainbow-lined waterfalls and thermal pools glowing through the fog.</p>

  <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>oke up to a light dusting of snow, which quickly turned into a rainy morning, but the weather didn’t put a damper on the day. Wildlife was practically waiting outside the lodge. A whole herd of buffalo grazed off in the distance, and a curious raven kept us company for a bit. A solid start early on our drive.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Later, we spotted a stunning elk with a full rack, standing tall in a wide, open field. A lone buffalo was nearby, both of them just vibing in the early morning air. I managed to snag a few zoom shots through the trees before we ventured on.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">We cruised along the lake and made a stop at some of the park’s bubbling thermal pools before heading toward Old Faithful. Classic Yellowstone stuff, still wild to see in person.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">The loop hike around Old Faithful was worth the time: caught a full eruption, plenty of mineral and thermal pools, and a few bonus geysers along the way. Tons of folks were getting way too close to the edge, walking over thin ground where the temps are no joke.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Wandered off to a there-and-back trail a bit and bumped into another lone buffalo, just chilling. It's great to see how casual these massive animals are. We then made our way out and popped into the Old Faithful Lodge for a quick peek. It’s a beautiful spot, but way too packed to stick around.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">The rain came and went, leaving a mostly moody grey sky all day. Threw on the rain jacket a few times, but it actually made for some pretty dramatic photos and some peaceful hikes.</p>

  <p class="margin-top-10"><span class="first-character sc">W</span>e kicked off our day trip to Grand Teton National Park with some bonus wildlife right out the gate with a small elk herd and a few buffalo lounging by the roadside. Always a good sign when you don’t even need to leave the car to start the day with a photo op.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Our first classic, postcard-worthy spot was Oxbox Bend. We paused for some shots of the river and spent a little time birdwatching; definitely worth taking a little time to watch for all the different species of cranes and ducks before moving on.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Next up, we hit the Taggart Lake Trail, starting near Jenny Lake. The path is a gorgeous mix of pines and aspen trees, a river rushing along one side, and occasional peeks of the Tetons through the cloud cover. We chose to add a  small detour to Bradley Lake to make it a nice 5-mile loop. Clouds were a little stubborn, but they gave the mountains this brooding, dramatic vibe in some our shots.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">From there, we drove over to Schwabacher Landing. Even with the peaks hiding behind the clouds, the views were still stunning. Lots of photographers had staked out their spots, tripods ready, just waiting for the perfect break in the sky. We hung back, watched some ducks splash around, and grabbed a quick snack in the car before heading out.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">The real surprise came back at the lodge. On the way to dinner, we ran into security casually rerouting foot traffic around a massive bison parked right on the main path. Super cool in the moment but a bit spookier walking back later in the dark, as we traced each shadow.</p>

  <p class="margin-top-10"><span class="first-character sc">S</span>tarted the day with another roadside bison moment with another lone giant grazing in the morning sun. We pulled over for a quick photoshoot and ended up chatting with some fellow travelers. These morning encounters alone make staying inside the park so worth it.</p>
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">As we cruised deeper into the park, we stopped here and there along some streams and rivers. It’s great how peaceful those little pull-offs can be with a mix of moving water, quiet trees, and the occasional wildlife sighting. Plus, always nice to just step out and literally touch some grass.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Next up was the Grand Prismatic Spring, which lives up to the hype, even with the heavier crowds. We took a couple of short hikes to reach a higher vantage point. The colors from above were worth the extra time.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">We wrapped the day at Upper Falls, taking our time along the drive. Caught sight of a few smaller waterfalls, a scattered elk herd, and even a rainbow stretching across the canyon. Hiked a little further down the canyon than I would of liked, but well worth the sore feet to catch the roaring river from more angles.</p>

  <p><span class="first-character atw">C</span>hecked out of our room but couldn’t resist soaking in one last dose of Yellowstone before heading out. The park definitely delivered on our way south; a full bison herd, a coyote trotting along the roadside, and even a quick bear sighting. Not bad for our final drive in the park.
  </p>
  
  <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">We made a stop at Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces, which was still steaming and surreal. Walked the boardwalks, snapped some final photos, and picked up a few souvenirs including a stuffed buffalo for Yuki (already a favorite). Quick lunch and one last look around before we crossed into Montana.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Dropped off the rental car and caught the shuttle to the Holiday Inn Express in Belgrade. Nice to land somewhere with solid AC, a comfy bed, and just enough white noise from the TV to catch some rest and brace for a early flight out. </p>
