### Artist & Designer

My work is constantly changing, I am always changing. My paintings, drawing and photographs are the product of my catharsis. I search for relationships between everything and everyone I encounter, and if I don't find one, I make one up. ![Anthony Overkamp reclining on couch with a scarf and knit hat](https://aoverkamp.com/portals/0/ao-scarf-2019-min.png "Anthony Overkamp reclining on couch with a scarf and knit hat") It's sometimes easier to imagine what I cant hear and see. My work becomes the bits and pieces I am unable to communicate openly with confidence. I try to use this to my advantage, being able to be more honest. My intention is to help myself and others to better understand my perception of the world around me and hopefully share something.

When working graphic and web design, I try to remind myself the rules I follow when approaching my fine art. I desire something clean and adjustable. I rely on color and strong visual composition to be the voice of my design.
