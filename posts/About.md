### Wave Cloud Pine? What is this about?

I enjoy traveling with family and friends, and am compelled to give myself creative assignments while on our travel adventures. Our days are almost always filled with food, history, interesting flora and fauna, and plenty of good company. I feverishly document as much as I can while also looking to reflect what I see along the way. This site is an atempt to keep track of some of those reflections as best as I can keep up. Lotta strands in old Duder's head.

The title for the site came from a book with the same name, [Wave Cloud Pine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2621338-wave-cloud-pine); an illustrated volume of Japanese paintings, textiles, and traditional crafts which feature the motifs of Japanese waves, clouds, and pines. A personal favorite for inspiration and a fun name for a photo blog. Check it out if that's your kind of thing.
